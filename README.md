# adaptamix

<b>Forked from:</b> Plank themes of Numix and Adapta

I found that original Adapta's Plank theme has too small in height, so I made this blend. It has Numix size, Adapta colors and animations. Credits goes to Adapta and Numix creators.

<b>How to Install:</b> Clone or download Adaptamix, then copy the downloaded folder to Plank theme folder (/usr/share/plank/themes).

<b>Numix's Github:</b> https://github.com/numixproject/numix-plank-theme
